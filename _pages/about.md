I am currently a member of the [Qwen Team](https://qwenlm.github.io/) at Alibaba, where I focus on enhancing the human alignment of large language models. I have been deeply involved in the development of the Qwen series models, including Qwen2.5, QwQ, and Qwen3. I graduated from Renmin University of China, where I conducted research under the supervision of Professor Wayne Xin Zhao in the [AI Box](https://aibox.ruc.edu.cn/).

Open Source Projects
=====
Most of my research work is open-source. Here are some of my preferred projects.

- [**TextBox**](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/TextBox) &nbsp; [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RUCAIBox/TextBox?style=social&label=Star)](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/TextBox)

  TextBox is an up-to-date text generation library based on Python and PyTorch focusing on building a unified and standardized pipeline for applying pre-trained language models to text generation.

- [**MVP**](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/mvp)
  
  MVP is a pre-trained language model specially designed for natural language generation tasks. MVP is supervised pre-trained (instruction tuned) using labeled datasets. We can have merged it into [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/RUCAIBox/mvp).
